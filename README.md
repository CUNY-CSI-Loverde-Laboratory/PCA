# PCA Analysis Of H3 N-terminal Tails
The example of PCA analysis of H3 N-terminal tail 1 and tail 2 are shown in the Jupyter notebooks here. PCA was performed in Python3 using MDAnalysis. The Jupyter notebook shows the both input and the expected output. Please note that the user may need to modify the input as per their requirement. The Jupyter notebook also contains the comments that can provide the guide for input. To perform PCA in Jupyter notebook (expected run time - 5 minutes based on our trajectory), expected output is already present in the notebook. 
# Software Requirements 
The Jupyter notebooks were tested on Ubuntu server 22.04 with python version 3.9.7 kernel using conda. The list of required python libraries is provided below. Install time might be 30 minutes. 
### Python Libraries
